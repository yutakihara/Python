Program Description, Interfaces, and Functionality
Air quality around the world varies greatly and depends on many factors (e.g. geographic locale, industrial polution, etc.). The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes data provided by each country for air quality in particulate matter (PM) for two sizes 10ug/m3 and 2.5ug/m3 named PM10 and PM2.5 in our data file. There are one or more readings for each country per city and year. We will combine all readings for each country and compute an aveargae PM2.5 value for the PM data stored in the air quality.tsv file. Furthermore, we will use the WHO’s PM2.5 thresholds for air quality health impacts to print out countries who exceed a given threshold.

In function make avg pm2 dictionary() create a dictionary to store a computed average PM2.5 value for each country from all cities and year records in the file air quality.tsv.
In the function add cia population data(. . . ) retrieve the popluation for each country with a PM2.5 value from the file cia population.tsv. The population data may need to be cleaned up using strip to remove extra quotation marks. Assemble the country name, population and PM2.5 data into a second dictionary that contains the country name as a the key and the population and PM2.5 as a list of values.

Finally, sort the data in the function print exceed threshold by country names and print the country name, population and PM2.5 value. Only print out the countries that exceed the WHO’s threshold (shown and represented in our dataset in ug/m3) for PM2.5 levels that increase long-term mortality risk by 15%
